# Java Process Inspector [JPI] üñ•Ô∏è

This is a sophisticated tool designed for dynamically browsing, analyzing, and modifying a running Java process ‚ö°

## Basic information

It allows users to interact with the Java application's live state, inspect its code, and make changes in real-time, offering a powerful solution for everyone, who need deep insights and control over Java applications during execution.

The program has a basic GUI that is easy to use and does not take up much memory.

## Functions

#### üîß Dynamic Executor for Java Code: 
This feature allows you to force the program, to which JPI is attached, to execute specific lines of code written in the built-in code editor provided with JPI. It offers full access to use any classes and methods, enabling real-time manipulation and testing of the application‚Äôs behavior.

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Memory Editor: 
The Memory Editor is a powerful tool that enables you to search for specific values within the process's memory and dynamically modify them while the process is running. This function provides direct access to the internal state of the application, allowing precise and immediate adjustments.

#### üîå DLL Injector: 
A straightforward tool designed to inject DLL files into the process. This function simplifies the process of adding external libraries, enabling extended functionality or modifications to the running application.

#### üîç Loaded Class Checker: 
This feature allows you to inspect all the classes loaded by the process, decompile them, and view their source code. Additionally, it provides the capability to dump all loaded classes to a specified folder.

## How to inject JPI
- To attach JPI to a java process, run Process Injector.exe
- Find the pid of the process you are interested in (java/javaw)
- Enter the pid of the process you want to attach JPI to (confirm with enter)
- Enter the full path to the dll file "injector.dll" (confirm with enter) `Example: C:\\Users\\whitedev\\Files\\injector.dll`
